GJ's Voice Assistant - I Made This Voice Assistant In Python 3 Using Google's Speech Recognition API

At First Voice Assistant Will Ask Your Name Then It Will Greet You According to Current Time Like Good Morning, Good Afternoon or Good Evening.

This Voice Assistant Can Play Music, Search Queries On Google, Open YouTube, Open Websites, Speak Random Inspirational Quotes By Using API,
It Can Search Something On Wikipedia For You, It Can Also Tell You The Current Time, You Can Also Ask Like 'What's My Name' and Assistant Will Tell You Your Name.

We Can Do Much More With This Assistant, We Just Have to Find APIs and Include it In This Program Like Weather API.
